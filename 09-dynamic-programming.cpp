 * Exercise 1: Fibonacci numbers
 * Let's warm up by writing a recursive fibonacci function.
 * Remember to add a base case so you can exit the recursive method calls.
 * Now add memoization, which caches fibonacci numbers as they are calculated.
 *
 * Extension: Create an alternative fib function which is iterative and stores
 * computations in a table (bottom-up approach) Question: What are performance
 * differences between iterative/tabulatation approach and the
 * recursive/memoization approach?

/*
 * Exercise 2: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
 *
 * Given two sequences, find the length of the longest subsequence present in
 * both of them.
 *
 * Step 1. Define a 2D dynamic programming table
 * Step 2. Initialise the base cases.
 * Step 3. Fill the table using the recurrence relation:
 *               If the characters of both sequences match:
 *                   dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
 *               else
 *                   dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
 * Step 4. The length of the LCS is in dp[m][n] where m and n are the lengths of
 * the two sequences.

/*
 * Exercise 3: Rucksack (knapsack) problem
 * Given a maximum weight that a rucksack (knapsack) can hold, write a function
 * which will determine the most valuable subset of items that can be included
 * in the rucksack without exceeding its weight limit.
 *
 * Inputs will be:
 *   W (the max weight the rucksack can hold)
 *   n (number of items)
 *   The weights and values of the items
 *
 * To go about this problem, start by defining a table where rows represent
 * items and columns represent possible weight capacities.

/*
 * Exercise 4: Floyd Warshall algorithm - all-pairs shortest paths
 * This is a dynamic programming approach to build up the solution for the
 * shortest paths step by step. It considers each pair of vertices and
 * iteratively improves the path between them by considering each possible
 * intermediate vertex.
 *
 * Step 1. Initialization:
 *   Create a 2D array dist where dist[i][j] represents the shortest distance
 * from vertex i to vertex j. Initialize dist[i][j] to the weight of the edge
 * from i to j if it exists, otherwise to infinity. Set dist[i][i] = 0 for all
 * vertices i.
 *
 * Step 2. Dynamic Programming:
 *   Update the distance array dist by considering each vertex as an
 * intermediate vertex and updating the shortest paths accordingly. For each
 * pair of vertices (i, j), update dist[i][j].
 *
 * Step 3. Result:
 *   After considering all vertices as intermediate vertices, the dist array
 * contains the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

/*
 * Exercise 5: Graph Boost
 * Start by checking you have access to the C++ Boost library
 * Create a graph with Boost's adjacency_list function
 * Then apply Boost's Dijkstra's algorithm to work out the shortest path to all
 * vertices. Also apply Boost's Floyd Warshall's all-pairs shortest path
 * algorithm.
 *
 * Question: what are the differences between your implementation
 *   and Boost's implementation of the Floyd Warshall's algorithm?
