 * Exercise 1: Implement a Graph class with a indexed structure
 * Create a Graph class and model the adjacent vertices as a matrix (e.g. a 2D
 * array). This matrix should hold the weights (the edges) for the connections
 * between vertices. In main, instantiate a Graph object, add vertices, and
 * connect these together with edges.
 *
 * Write a print/display method and check that you can visualise the adjacency
 * matrix. Below is a sample output to give you an example of the vertices (A-E)
 * and their edge connections:
 *
 *   A B C D E
 * A 0 1 0 0 7
 * B 0 4 0 7 0
 * C 2 0 5 0 0
 * D 0 0 0 9 0

 * Exercise 2: Implement a Graph with a referenced structure

 * You could build the edge weights into the nodes of each list, as these would
 * individual to each connection. You could use your LinkedList class from
 * previous exercises or select an appropriate STL structure - a pair, list, map
 * or other.
 *
 * Set up a new Graph, with vertices and edges and check these are stored
 * correctly in the adjacency list. Create a print / display method to check.

/*
 * Exercise 5: Topological Sort
 * Topological Sort orders vertices so that each node/vertex appears only after
 * all the nodes pointing to it have appeared. Apply your DFS algorithm, in
 * combination with a structure to print nodes of graph by these rules. This
 * could be done via a vector or a hash table / unordered_map.
 *
 * Example: For a graph with 4 nodes and these relations: a->b, a->c, b->d,
 * c->d, there are two acceptable topological sorts: a, b, c, d and a, c, b, d.
 *
 * Note: Topological Sort is not feasible in graphs that have a cycle.
 *       Therefore, it is helpful to first detect whether a graph has a cycle.
 *       If you've already completed the extension for exercise 3 (DFS), feel
 * free to reuse this here.
